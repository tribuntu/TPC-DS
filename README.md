# Decision Support Benchmark for Greenplum database.

This is the decision support (DS) benchmark derived from [TPC-DS](http://tpc.org/tpcds/).
This repo contains automation of running the DS benchmark against an existing Greenplum cluster.

## Context
### Supported Greenplum Versions

- [VMware Tanzu Greenplum](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/vmware-tanzu-greenplum/) `4.3.x`, `5.x`, `6.x`
- [Open Source Greenplum Databases](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/greenplum-database/) `5.x`, `6.x`

### Supported TPC-DS Versions

TPC has published the following TPC-DS standards over time:
| TPC-DS Benchmark Version | Published Date | Standard Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 3.2.0 (latest) | 2021/06/15 | http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v3.2.0.pdf |
| 2.1.0 | 2015/11/12 | http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v2.1.0.pdf |
| 1.3.1 (earliest) | 2015/02/19 | http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v1.3.1.pdf |

These are the combined versions of TPC-DS and Greenplum:
| DS Benchmark Version | TPC-DS Benchmark Version | Greenplum Version |
|-|-|-|
| 3.0.0 | 2.1.0 | 4.3.x, 5.x, 6.x |
| 2.2.x | 2.1.0 | 4.3.x, 5.x |
| 2.x | 2.1.0 | 4.3.x |

## Setup
### Prerequisites

1. A running Greenplum Database with `gpadmin` access
2. `gpadmin` database is created
3. `root` access on the master node `mdw` for installing dependencies
4. `ssh` connections between `mdw` and the segment nodes `sdw1..n`

All the following examples are using standard host name convention of Greenplum using `mdw` for master node, and `sdw1..n` for the segment nodes.

### TPC-DS Tools Dependencies

Install the dependencies on `mdw` for compiling the `dsdgen` (data generation) and `dsqgen` (query generation).

```bash
ssh root@mdw
yum -y install gcc make
```

Note:  If you are using Photon OS, then you need:

```bash
yum -y install build-essential
```

The original source code is from http://tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp.

### Download and Install

Visit the repo at https://github.com/pivotal/TPC-DS/releases and download the tarball to the `mdw` node.

```bash
ssh gpadmin@mdw
curl -LO https://github.com/pivotal/TPC-DS/archive/refs/tags/v3.5.0.tar.gz
tar xzf v3.5.0.tar.gz
mv TPC-DS-3.5.0 TPC-DS
```

## Usage

To run the benchmark, login as `gpadmin` on `mdw:

```
ssh gpadmin@mdw
cd ~/TPC-DS
./tpcds.sh
```

By default, it will run a scale 1 (1G) and with 2 concurrent users, from data generation to score computation.

### Configuration Options

By changing the `tpcds_variables.sh`, we can control how this benchmark will run.

This is the default example at [tpcds_variables.sh](https://github.com/pivotal/TPC-DS/blob/main/tpcds_variables.sh)

```shell
# environment options
ADMIN_USER="gpadmin"

# benchmark options
GEN_DATA_SCALE="1"
MULTI_USER_COUNT="2"

# step options
RUN_COMPILE_TPCDS="true"
RUN_GEN_DATA="true"
RUN_INIT="true"
RUN_DDL="true"
RUN_LOAD="true"
RUN_SQL="true"
RUN_SINGLE_USER_REPORTS="true"
RUN_MULTI_USER="true"
RUN_MULTI_USER_REPORTS="true"
RUN_SCORE="true"

# misc options
SINGLE_USER_ITERATIONS="1"
EXPLAIN_ANALYZE="false"
RANDOM_DISTRIBUTION="false"
```

`tpcds.sh` will validate existence of those variables.

#### Environment Options

```shell
# environment options
ADMIN_USER="gpadmin"
```

These are the setup related variables:
- `ADMIN_USER`: default `gpadmin`.
  It is the default database administrator account, as well as the user accessible to all `mdw` and `sdw1..n` machines.

  Note: The benchmark related files for each segment node are located in the segment's `${PGDATA}/dsbenchmark` directory.
  If there isn't enough space in this directory in each segment, you can create a symbolic link to a drive location that does have enough space.

In most cases, we just leave them to the default.

#### Benchmark Options

```shell
# benchmark options
GEN_DATA_SCALE="1"
MULTI_USER_COUNT="2"
```

These are the benchmark controlling variables:
- `GEN_DATA_SCALE`: default `1`.
  Scale 1 is 1G.
- `MULTI_USER_COUNT`: default `2`.
  It's also usually referred as `CU`, i.e. concurrent user.
  It controls how many concurrent streams to run during the throughput run.


If evaluating Greenplum cluster across different platforms, we recommend to change this section to 3TB with 5CU:
```shell
# benchmark options
MULTI_USER_COUNT="5"
GEN_DATA_SCALE="3000"
```
#### Step Options

```shell
# step options
RUN_COMPILE_TPCDS="true"
RUN_GEN_DATA="true"
RUN_INIT="true"
RUN_DDL="true"
RUN_LOAD="true"
RUN_SQL="true"
RUN_SINGLE_USER_REPORT="true"
RUN_MULTI_USER="true"
RUN_MULTI_USER_REPORTS="true"
RUN_SCORE="true"
```

There are multiple steps running the benchmark and controlled by these variables:
- `RUN_COMPILE_TPCDS`: default `true`.
  It will compile the `dsdgen` and `dsqgen`.
  Usually we only want to compile those binaries once.
  In the rerun, just set this value to `false`.
- `RUN_GEN_DATA`: default `true`.
  It will use the `dsdgen` compiled above to generate the flat files for the benchmark.
  The flat files are generated in parallel on all segment nodes.
  Those files are stored under `${PGDATA}/dsbenchmark` directory.
  In the rerun, just set this value to `false`.
- `RUN_INIT`: default `true`.
  It will setup the GUCs for the Greenplum as well as remember the segment configurations.
  It's only required if the Greenplum cluster is reconfigured.
  It can be always `true` to ensure proper Greenplum cluster configuration.
  In the rerun, just set this value to `false`.
- `RUN_DDL`: default `true`.
  It will recreate all the schemas and tables (including external tables for loading).
  If you want to keep the data and just rerun the queries, please set this value to `false`, otherwise all the existing loaded data will be gone.
- `RUN_LOAD`: default `true`.
  It will load data from flat files into tables.
  After the load, the statistics will be computed in this step.
  If you just want to rerun the queries, please set this value to `false`.
- `RUN_SQL`: default `true`.
  It will run the power test of the benchmark.
- `RUN_SINGLE_USER_REPORTS`: default `true`.
  It will upload the results to the Greenplum database `gpadmin` under schema `tpcds_reports`.
  These tables are required later on in the `RUN_SCORE` step.
  Recommend to keep it `true` if above step of `RUN_SQL` is `true`.
- `RUN_MULTI_USER`: default `true`.
  It will run the throughput run of the benchmark.
  Before running the queries, multiple streams will be generated by the `dsqgen`.
  `dsqgen` will sample the database to find proper filters.
  For very large database and a lot of streams, this process can take a long time (hours) to just generate the queries.
- `RUN_MULTI_USER_REPORTS`: default `true`.
  It will upload the results to the Greenplum database `gpadmin` under schema `tpcds_reports`.
  Recommend to keep it `true` if above step of `RUN_MULTI_USER` is `true`.
- `RUN_SCORE`: default `true`.
  It will query the results from `tpcds_reports` and compute the `QphDS` based on supported benchmark standard.
  Recommend to keep it `true` if you want to see the final score of the run.

If any above variable is missing or invalid, the script will abort and show the missing or invalid variable name.

**WARNING**: Now TPC-DS does not rely on the log folder to run or skip the steps. It will only run the steps that are specified explicitly as `true`  in the `tpcds_variables.sh`. If any necessary step is speficied as `false` but has never been executed before, the script will abort when it tries to access something that does not exist in the database or under the directory.

#### Miscellaneous Options

```shell
# misc options
EXPLAIN_ANALYZE="false"
RANDOM_DISTRIBUTION="false"
SINGLE_USER_ITERATIONS="1"
```

These are miscellaneous controlling variables:
- `EXPLAIN_ANALYZE`: default `false`.
  If you set to `true`, you can have the queries execute with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in order to see exactly the query plan used, the cost, the memory used, etc.
  This option is for debugging purpose only, since collecting those query statistics will disturb the benchmark.
- `RANDOM_DISTRIBUTION`: default `false`.
  If you set to `true`, the fact tables are distributed randomly other than following a pre-defined distribution column.
- `SINGLE_USER_ITERATION`: default `1`.
  This controls how many times the power test will run.
  During the final score computation, the minimal/fastest query elapsed time of multiple runs will be used.
  This can be used to ensure the power test is in a `warm` run environment.

### Storage Options

Table storage is defined in `functions.sh` and is configured for optimal performance.
`get_version()` function defines different storage options for different scale of the benchmark.
- `SMALL_STORAGE`: All the dimension tables
- `MEDIUM_STORAGE`: `catalog_returns` and `store_returns`
- `LARGE_STORAGE`: `catalog_sales`, `inventory`, `store_sales`, and `web_sales`

### Execution

Example of running the benchmark as `root` as a background process:

```bash
nohup ./tpcds.sh &> tpcds.log &
```

## Minumum Required Query Streams

According to https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/presentations/the_making_of_tpcds.pdf,
but not in the TPC-DS specification,
figure 12 indicates the following minimum query streams by the scale factor.

| Scale Factor | Minimum Number of Streams |
|-|-|
| 100 | 3 |
| 300 | 5 |
| 1,000 | 7 |
| 3,000 | 9 |
| 10,000 | 11 |
| 30,000 | 13 |
| 100,000 | 15 |


## Benchmark Minor Modifications

### 1. Change to SQL queries that subtracted or added days were modified slightly:

Old:
```sql
and (cast('2000-02-28' as date) + 30 days)
```

New:

```sql
and (cast('2000-02-28' as date) + '30 days'::interval)
```

This was done on queries: 5, 12, 16, 20, 21, 32, 37, 40, 77, 80, 82, 92, 94, 95, and 98.

### 2. Change to queries with ORDER BY on column alias to use sub-select.

Old:
```sql
select  
    sum(ss_net_profit) as total_sum
   ,s_state
   ,s_county
   ,grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county) as lochierarchy
   ,rank() over (
 	partition by grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county),
 	case when grouping(s_county) = 0 then s_state end 
 	order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as rank_within_parent
 from
    store_sales
   ,date_dim       d1
   ,store
 where
    d1.d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212+11
 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
 and s_state in
             ( select s_state
               from  (select s_state as s_state,
 			    rank() over ( partition by s_state order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as ranking
                      from   store_sales, store, date_dim
                      where  d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212+11
 			    and d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 			    and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
                      group by s_state
                     ) tmp1 
               where ranking <= 5
             )
 group by rollup(s_state,s_county)
 order by
   lochierarchy desc
  ,case when lochierarchy = 0 then s_state end
  ,rank_within_parent
 limit 100;
```

New:
```sql
select * from ( --new
select  
    sum(ss_net_profit) as total_sum
   ,s_state
   ,s_county
   ,grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county) as lochierarchy
   ,rank() over (
 	partition by grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county),
 	case when grouping(s_county) = 0 then s_state end 
 	order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as rank_within_parent
 from
    store_sales
   ,date_dim       d1
   ,store
 where
    d1.d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212+11
 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
 and s_state in
             ( select s_state
               from  (select s_state as s_state,
 			    rank() over ( partition by s_state order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as ranking
                      from   store_sales, store, date_dim
                      where  d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212+11
 			    and d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 			    and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
                      group by s_state
                     ) tmp1 
               where ranking <= 5
             )
 group by rollup(s_state,s_county)
) AS sub --new
 order by
   lochierarchy desc
  ,case when lochierarchy = 0 then s_state end
  ,rank_within_parent
 limit 100;
```

This was done on queries: 36 and 70.

### 3. Query templates were modified to exclude columns not found in the query.

In these cases, the common table expression used aliased columns but the dynamic filters included both the alias name as well as the original name.
Referencing the original column name instead of the alias causes the query parser to not find the column.

This was done on query 86.

### 4. Added table aliases.
This was done on queries: 2, 14, and 23.

### 5. Added `limit 100` to very large result set queries.
For the larger tests (e.g. 15TB), a few of the TPC-DS queries can output a very large number of rows which are just discarded.

This was done on queries: 64, 34, and 71.

### 6. Changed `integer` to `bigint` to handle larger scale.

For larger tests (50TB and up), data load will fail due to out of range numbers.

This is done on loading of `web_sales`, and `web_returns`.
